# Untitled AA Engine
There hasn't been a satisfactory Ace Attorney fancase maker in some time. PyWright relies on ancient Python 2.7 code and is no longer maintained, AAOnline is not quite extensible enough, and objection.lol is not remotely powerful enough to be a true recreation of the first three Ace Attorney games' (and perhaps arguably AJ:AA's as well) engine. This hopes to solve that.
## Dependencies
You'll need a version of Love2D of at least 11.0 installed on your local machine.
## Running the example case
Navigate to the root directory of the repository from a command line and enter `love . example`. It should work fine from there.
