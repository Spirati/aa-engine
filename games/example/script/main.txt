    This is an example of the capabilities of the very earliest version of the
    (to be renamed) Visn Ace Attorney engine.
    There's a lot of work to be done -- the code isn't optimized, and it relies on
    assets from PyWright pretty heavily. 
    However -- the scripting is primed to be intuitive and capable, and much of
    the groundwork is in place.

    Full support for cross-examination, Psyche-Locks, investigation, 
    and more is intended.
    XML-like markup for text styling is almost ready, with easy access to shaking the 
    screen, coloring text, producing sound effects, and more.

    You'll just have to give me time to finish this tag parser... Lua isn't great for
    working with strings of any kind.

    Contributions are welcomed and appreciated! My dream is for the community to get
    involved in this passion project of mine. I adore the Ace Attorney games so much,
    and getting to empower the community to be more creative is the most I could 
    ever hope to do!
